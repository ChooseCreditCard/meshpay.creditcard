        <h1>How Mesh Payment Routing Works Behind Your Card</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Modern payment stacks rarely rely on a single acquirer or processor. Instead they use a
          mesh of connections and routing rules to keep card payments online, optimized and resilient
          across markets and networks.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is Mesh Routing in Card Payments?</h2>
      <p>
        In a traditional setup, a merchant sends card transactions through a single acquirer or
        processor. If that provider has an outage, risk rule change or regional limitation, payments
        can fail or be more expensive than necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mesh routing</strong> means building a network of multiple acquirers, processors
        and rails, then choosing the best path for each transaction. That path can depend on card
        type, region, currency, risk signals, cost or performance data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: higher approval rates, lower total cost of acceptance, and more robust
        uptime for merchants processing large volumes or operating across many countries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Routing models -->
    <section id="routing" class="section">
      <h2>Common Mesh Routing Models</h2>
      <p>
        Different merchants and platforms implement mesh routing in different ways. Typical models include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Failover routing:</strong> send traffic to a preferred acquirer and only switch
          to a backup when there is an outage or a spike in declines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Geo-optimized routing:</strong> choose acquirers based on the card’s region,
          issuer country or currency, to benefit from better local approval rates or fee structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bin- or scheme-based routing:</strong> route certain BIN ranges, card schemes or
          card types to specific providers that perform better for those segments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance-optimized routing:</strong> dynamically balance traffic based on
          real-time data about approval rates, latency and error codes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These strategies are often implemented by payment orchestrators or by merchants with their
        own in-house routing logic on top of API-based card processors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits -->
    <section id="benefits" class="section">
      <h2>Why Mesh Routing Matters for Card Payments</h2>
      <p>
        For cardholders, mesh routing is invisible: the card “just works”. For merchants and
        platforms, the underlying routing strategy can materially change economics and reliability.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher approval rates:</strong> using the most suitable acquirer for each card
          type or region can reduce unnecessary declines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower costs:</strong> routing high-volume or low-risk traffic to cheaper options,
          while retaining premium providers where needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resilience:</strong> automatic failover between providers during incidents
          keeps checkout flows live.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> easier to test new providers, networks or alternative rails
          without rewriting the entire integration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the issuer and network side, mesh routing can affect how traffic appears, which in turn
        shapes risk models, interchange flows and scheme fees.
      </p>

    <!-- Risk & complexity -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Trade-Offs: Complexity, Compliance & Data</h2>
      <p>
        A mesh setup is not free of trade-offs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical complexity:</strong> orchestrating multiple providers requires careful
          integration, monitoring and error handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data consistency:</strong> settlement files, reconciliation and reporting become
          more complex when many acquirers are involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance & contracts:</strong> each provider comes with its own rules,
          onboarding processes and regulatory obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk fragmentation:</strong> fraud signals and chargeback data may be spread
          across several systems rather than centralized.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Well-designed orchestration layers and clear ownership of reconciliation and compliance are
        crucial to capture the upside of mesh routing without losing control.
