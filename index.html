      <h2>What Is a Mesh Payment Model?</h2>
      <p>
        A mesh payment model refers to a network where transactions can be routed peer-to-peer, possibly outside centralized intermediaries — using local channels, off-chain data, wallets or even ad-hoc network overlays. The idea is that payments are not tied strictly to banks or card schemes, but can move flexibly between nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cardholders, this could mean linking a mesh-wallet or peer-to-peer balance to a card, enabling spending without a traditional bank account. Alternatively, mesh-enabled wallets might top up fiat balances behind the scenes while preserving privacy and decentralisation benefits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Mesh-to-Card Payment Bridges Might Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you initiate a payment from a mesh wallet, a bridge service might convert or route value into fiat and then trigger a standard card authorisation on your behalf — masking the mesh origin from the merchant. This requires a backend that monitors wallet balances, executes conversion or settlement, and issues the card transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some models might use stablecoins, off-chain ledgers or pooled liquidity to smooth volatility and liquidity constraints. At settlement time, the bridge ensures the card network receives fiat funds, even if the original value originated in a decentralized wallet.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Potential Benefits and Trade-offs</h2>
      <p>
        **Benefits** include increased financial inclusion (for unbanked users), enhanced privacy, flexible routing and access to global liquidity. A mesh model could also reduce dependency on single point-of-failure intermediaries and offer programmable payment logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        **Trade-offs** may involve increased complexity, bridging costs, regulatory uncertainty, KYC/AML compliance challenges and potential delays when converting or routing funds. The experience might also resemble a hybrid between a crypto card and a traditional payment — with associated volatility and risk.
